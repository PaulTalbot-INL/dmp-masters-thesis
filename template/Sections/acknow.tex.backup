	\indent I would like to thank Dr. Todd Palmer for recruting me to the Nuclear Engineering department and the numerouse times he put off his work to help me with homework durring my undergrad. I would also like to thank him for his continued detication to my graduate work in which he secured funding, internships, and self asherance in my abilities. It has been an honer to work with him and it is safe to say that without his help I would have never relized my full potential. 

\noindent
	\indent I would like to thank Dr. Nick Gentile who I worked at LLNL. I would like to thank him for his dedication to my thesis work, his friendship, and his generousity for the duration of my stay at LLNL. This thesis work was orginal suggested by him and I could not have done it with out his help.
	
\noindent 
	\indent I would like to thak my Committee members; Dr. Brian Woods, Dr. Sourabh Apte, and Dr. Ken Krane, for their time and commitment to my thesis work. With out their approvail and valuable feedback this document would not have been possible.
	
\noindent
	\indent I would also like to thank my friend and fellow graduate students Nathan (Explosian) Barnett, Dr. Wesly (J. Westerferd) Frey, and Mike Rissing. Nathan and I have worked with eachother throughout our undergrad and graduate work. He has been very helpful in developing my ``skills'' in engineering and I value his friendship. Wes, as a doctorial canidate, has been a strong ``rolemodel'' for me throughout my graduate work. Mike, a fellow grad student working under Dr. Palmer, has helped me on many occasiance with my reseach and as a general ``math wiz'' I look forward to his help on future projects.Although I did not get the opportunity to work directly with Brenton Ching or Ian Davis, as a former graduate students of Dr. Palmer's, their organized coding style, \LaTeX\ styling, and excellent theses were invaluable references to me.
	
\noindent
	\indent I would like to thank my entire famly for the contued support, both finacialy and emotionaly, through out my accidemic carrier. I would like to especial thank my wife ``Dr.'' Kate Cleveland. She has supported me through the many highs and lows of my accidemic carrier, and with out her love and dedication I can truly say I would have never made it this far. I would also like to thank all of my friends for there support and friendship. I would especial like to thank Glenn Johnston (``Mr. J'') and Margeret Osborn (``Mo''). Mr. J was my 9th grade science teacher. He has been a valuable family friend and role model. My achivements can be dirrectly attributed to his dedication as a teacher and a friend. Margeret has always supported me and belived in me. I would not be where I am today without her support and dedication to keeping me ``in line and out of truble'' throughtout my early adult life. Thanks to her ``sturn'' but gental approch I have over come many obsticals and achived what some though I could not.
 
\noindent
	\indent Finaly I would like to thank my mother Betty Cleveland. She has been an insperation to me over the years and without her love and dedication, to myself and my family, I would never have made it this far.
