\section{Results}
While to this point insufficient progress has been made to allow rigorous
testing of the discrete maximum principle coding within a use code, test
scripts were developed that evaluate the ability of the class
\texttt{DiscreteMaxPrinciple} to test for DMP violations around
previously-performed numerical analyses.  The \texttt{DiscreteMaxPrinciple}
class implements all of the adjustments to the DMP discussed to this point in
this work into a \texttt{C++} code environment intended to be used within
\texttt{clubimc}, developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. To test this
class, the same input parameters as in \cite{WolLarDen} were used and a
dozen
test cases were checked. Half of these tests had $\Delta_t,\Delta_x$ pairs that
were expected to narrowly violate the DMP, and the other half were expected to
just avoid violation. Figure \ref{passfail} shows the data points selected with
reference to the experimental DMP line of demarcation developed in
\cite{WolLarDen}, both as a whole and then magnified to see individual test
cases.  Each graph has axes of $\Delta_t$ on the x-axis and $\Delta_x$ on the
y-axis.

The table below shows the results of the test cases:

In the table the above, time is in shakes, distance in centimeters, and the
expected and calculated inequalities represent the value of Eq.\ \eqref{FINAL
dmp} if the $\Delta_t$ is subtracted to the right side; that is, values less
than zero violate the DMP, while those greater than zero do not.  The expected
results are from the numerical tool used in \cite{WolLarDen}, adjusted
slightly to perform multigroup calculations, and the calculated results were
obtained using the \texttt{DiscreteMaxPrinciple} class.

As can be seen, the results obtained agree very readily with the results
obtained in \cite{WolLarDen} and show, at least to a first degree, some
accuracy in this application of the discrete maximum principle to the
implicit Monte Carlo equations.
