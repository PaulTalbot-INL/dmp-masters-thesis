Literature Review: Some non-original derivations in this section, summarize previous results
 - Fleck and Cummings
    :IMC equations derived
    :noted problems for given time steps/spatial steps

    :agrees with experiment
    :pseudo-analytic
    :limitations


Methods: pretty much all derivation here
 - Non-equilibrium initial conditions
    :rad. field and material not necc. in agreement
