%\begin{abstract}
%In recent papers regarding the Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP) for the 
%Implicit Monte Carlo equations, a model problem is considered for the 
%first time-step under the assumption that the initial temperatures in 
%the radiation field and coupled material are in equilibrium.   In this 
%work, we have removed the equilibrium assumption and introduced 
%approximations to allow computation of the DMP at the beginning of each 
%time step.  An additional generalization is performed that allows the 
%DMP to apply to each cell, not just the boundary cell.  We have 
%integrated these calculations, along with unit tests, into Jayenne 
%project software as a step toward generating a physics-based time-step 
%limiter for the IMC equations.
